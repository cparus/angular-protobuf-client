# AngularProtobufClient

This Angular project will recieve binary data from a http request and convert it into a list of objects using protobufs.

# Getting google protobuf to work with angular
See the README from: https://github.com/sparten11740/angular-protobuf-example. This project was a great reference and I followed the general pattern he laid out. 

Also, if you're on a Mac, this link may help you get the protobuf compiler installed on your machine. https://medium.com/@erika_dike/installing-the-protobuf-compiler-on-a-mac-a0d397af46b8

# Run the project
It will error unless ran against https://github.com/cparus/dotnet-protobuf-api

`npm install` `ng serve`

Will output list of objects to console.
